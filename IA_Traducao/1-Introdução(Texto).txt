Foundational knowledge
on generative AI is essential as the first step in this journey of finding more, what is generative AI all about? We'll look a little bit about the brief history and
the evolution of AI. What was it like
10, 50 years ago, and where are we right now? Maybe a hint of
what are the things that we're looking at
as we move forward. Then we'll take a look at how these large language models, as we call them, how do
they work in applications? How are these connected and how everything is
happening behind the scenes. Demystify how these things are working together in order to
provide a good experience. Finally, we'll talk
a little bit of how these machine
learning models and in this case large
language models, how are they created? What does it take to build one? What are some of the things
that need to happen in order for the creation of a
large language model. It is tricky, it is complex, but we'll try to make it very straightforward so
that you have a good, solid understanding on all of these pieces
as we move along.
